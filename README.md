Hello! Welcome to my **Personal Data Science Projects** repository! 🎉

I am **Novrian Pratama** 👨‍💻, someone who is deeply interested in **Data Science**, **Data Analytics**, and **AI Engineering** 🤖. In this repository, I collect all the personal projects I have worked on in the field of **Data Science**. Each folder contains a project that I have completed, along with the **source code**, **description**, and a brief explanation of how each model works.

### Why This Repository Exists? 🤔
The main purpose of this repository is to:

- Store and document various **personal projects** I’ve created in the world of **Data Science** 🗂️.
- Showcase data analysis solutions and the implementation of **Machine Learning** or **AI** technologies I have learned through personal experimentation 💡.
- Provide **code examples** and explanations that can help anyone who wants to learn more or find inspiration 👨‍💻.
- Serve as my **portfolio** that can be accessed by anyone interested in viewing my work 🌍.

### My Interests 🔍
Here are some of my key interests:

- **Data Science** 📊: Processing and analyzing data to gain **valuable insights**. I am interested in modeling techniques and data visualization to uncover information from large and complex datasets.
- **Data Analytics** 📈: Discovering patterns in data to support **business or technical decision-making**. Through statistical analysis and data exploration, I help understand trends that influence decisions.
- **AI Engineering** 🤖: Building solutions based on **artificial intelligence** to solve real-world problems. I work with algorithms like **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing** to develop smarter applications.

### Thank You for Visiting!
Thank you for taking the time to visit this repository. I hope the projects I share here provide value or inspiration, whether for learning or reference. Feel free to provide feedback or reach out if you have any questions! 😊
